# Predicting-power-output-next-6-months-from-Wind-Turbine

* Main task was to tackle the problem of seasonality in the data
* Used a data collected from a wind turbine for a whole year (2015)
* Used several machine learning algorithms like:- BART, MART, Random forest, NeuralNet, Binning
* Predicted wind power output from the turbine for next 6 months(Jan 2016 - June 2016)
* Got minimum error with ensemble method (Binning + MART)
* This method tackled seasonality very efficiently
* My team(3 member including me) got the first place among 10 teams participating
* Got A grade and a lunch from the professor :D :D
